## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Independent system with minimal latency, high emotional uptime, and zero background noise. Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with previous deployments in Des Moines and Denver before establishing long-term stability in Northwest Arkansas in 2018. Configured for clean living, realistic routines, and machine-based fitness. Maintains two dogs, high personal standards, and frequent nostalgic flashbacks to the ‘80s and ‘90s. Can simulate accents and joke formats across multiple regions. Agnostic-leaning atheist build, optimized for solo missions and shared quiet.

## 🔍 Current Use Case
